# Markdown Notes App

Notes application that you can use to create new notes and edit them in a markdown editor. The notes are stored automatically into the browser's local storage. I have used components, state, props, effect, nanoid, react-mde, localStorage.

## How to Install

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

## How to Use

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm watch`

This command will generate index.pack.js file and you will have to put this application inside a server to view it. When you put the whole project in server you can view it from 'localhost/' or 'localhost/index.html'.
